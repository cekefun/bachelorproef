\section{Visualization files}
\label{sec:files}

Visualization files (\texttt{*\_vis.json}) are only able to be produced by the simulator when working with a population generated from a geographical distribution, as otherwise there's no data to determine the locations of clusters on a map. Generation of visualization files is also prevented with use of the \texttt{-V} or \texttt{{-}-no-vis} flag.

The simulator will add new data to the visualization file with every 10th simulated day. This means the file can be used to visualize simulation results even before the simulator finishes running. To help with this, once the file has been specified to the visualizer, it will automatically load the latest data from the file in the case it is updated.

\subsection{Format}

The visualization file employs the following json format:

The root of the file is an Object with two fields:
\begin{compactitem}	
	\item \texttt{towns}: An array of town Objects, each with four fields:
	\begin{compactitem}	
		\item \texttt{name}: The town's name.
		\item \texttt{size}: The town's number of inhabitants.
		\item \texttt{lat}: The town's latitude.
		\item \texttt{long}: The town's longitude.
	\end{compactitem}
	\pagebreak
	
	\item \texttt{days}: An array of various Objects:\\
	\texttt{days[0]}: An Object with multiple fields:
	\begin{compactitem}				
		\item \texttt{\$townId} : The number of infected in \texttt{towns[\$townId]} on the first day.\\
		If a specific \texttt{\$townId} field is not present, its value is assumed to be 0.
	\end{compactitem}
	\texttt{days[n]} for $n > 0$: An Object with multiple fields:
	\begin{compactitem}				
		\item \texttt{\$townId} : The difference in number of infected in \texttt{towns[\$townId]} between the n\textsuperscript{th} day and the previous day.\\
		If a specific \texttt{\$townId} field is not present, its value is assumed to be 0.
	\end{compactitem}
	
	\vspace{4pt}
	If a certain day contains no entries its place may instead hold an empty string.
\end{compactitem}

All values are allowed to be

\end{figure}

The visualizer is a JavaScript-based browser application. It is included in the Stride distribution in \texttt{src/main/resources/html/index.html}, or it can be accessed from \url{https://flu-plus-plus.github.io/visualizer/}.


\subsection{Loading a file}

To load a visualization file simply click the "Select file" button on the control panel. Selecting a file automatically analyses the data and starts the visualization. This also sets the the visualizer to monitor changes made to the file (see \ref{sec:files}).

\subsection{Controlling time}
\label{sub:control}

On the control panel, use the left and right buttons to step through the timeline one day at a time, or use the slider for greater control over the currently visualized day.

The checkbox marked ``{Run}'' will cause the visualizer to automatically step through the timeline one day at a time until it reaches the end. If the box marked ``{Loop}'' is checked the visualizer will instead jump back to the first day and continue running.


\subsection{The map view}

After loading a valid file, the map view will automatically plot the data on an appropriate map. By default the visualizer will fall back to a high-resolution map of the entire world. If you wish to extend the visualizer to use more appropriate map images for plotting, consult \texttt{Map.js}.

Each location is represented by a circle on the map with several attributes:

\begin{compactitem}

\item \textbf{Size:} The size of the circle corresponds to the number of inhabitants in that location.
\item \textbf{Colour:} The colour of the circle corresponds to the amount of infected inhabitants in the location. For more info see the section on the legend panel.
\item \textbf{Hover:} Hovering over a circle will display the name of the location it represents.
\item \textbf{Click:} Clicking a circle will open a new location specific panel.

\end{compactitem}

\subsection{The legend panel}
\label{sub:legend}

The legend panel shows and controls the map's colour coding.

The selector labeled ``Colours'' allows you to choose the colour scheme employed by the map view. Options include \textit{Monochrome}, \textit{Heat map} and \textit{Rainbow}. If you wish to add more possible colour schemes, consult \texttt{Colour.js}.

The selector labeled ``Scale'' allows you to choose what the colours represent:
\begin{compactitem}
	
	\item \textbf{Count:} The colour of a circle corresponds to the absolute quantity of infected.
	\item \textbf{Percentage:} The colour of a circle corresponds to the percentage of infected.
	
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{The table view}

The table view is an alternate visualization option, showing the same data as the map except in a text-based representation. It is accessed by clicking the ``Table'' tab at the top of the page.

The columns are as follows:

\begin{compactitem}
	
	\item \textbf{Name:} The name of the location. Clicking this will open a location specific panel.
	\item \textbf{Inhabitants:} The total number of inhabitants in the location.
	\item \textbf{Current infected:} The absolute and relative quantity of infected in the location.
	\item \textbf{Most infected:} The highest number of infected in that location, and the day on which it happened. Clicking the day will automatically set the timeline to that day.
	
\end{compactitem}


\subsection{The panels}

Panels can be moved, minimized, and some can be deleted.

The control panel and legend panel have already been discussed (see \ref{sub:control} and \ref{sub:legend}).

\subsubsection{General stats panel}
This panel holds information that is constant for the entire file.
\begin{compactitem}	
	\item \textbf{Total days:} The total number of logged days.
	\item \textbf{Total people:} The total number of inhabitants across all locations.
	\item \textbf{Total towns:} The total number of different locations.
	\item \textbf{Most infected:} The highest total number of infected of all time, and the day on which it happened. Clicking the day will automatically set the timeline to that day.
\end{compactitem}


\subsubsection{Daily stats panel}
This panel holds information that changes between days.
\begin{compactitem}	
	\item \textbf{Day:} The currently selected day, compared to the total number of days.
	\item \textbf{Infected:} The total number of infected across all locations, compared to the total number of people.
	\item \textbf{Most infected:} The highest number of infected in a single location, and the location on which it happened. Clicking the location name will open a location specific panel.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Total infected over time panel}
This panel shows a graph representing the total percentage of infected over time. The red line highlights the currently visualized day.

\subsubsection{Location specific panels}
These panels show data specific to a given location.
\begin{compactitem}	
	\item \textbf{Infected:} The number of infected, compared to the number of inhabitants.
	\item \textbf{Most infected:} The highest number of infected of all time, and the day on which it happened. Clicking the day will automatically set the timeline to that day.
	\item A graph showing the percentage of infected in the location over time.
\end{compactitem}
